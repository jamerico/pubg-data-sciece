# Repository for an M.Sc Lecture at Coppe/UFRJ.

All the data came from the Kaggle competition [1].

The work includes:

1 - Data Visualization:

- Describe the generalized math formulation of a linear generalized model and the parameter adjustment algorithm. (theoretical)
- Describe the regularization problem and bad-conditioning effects on the result 
- Basic statistics of each variable
- Analyze the distribution of each variable
- Analyze outliers.
- Check the correlations.

2 - Prediction and Analysis in Linear Models:
- Describe the mathematical formulation of the utilized model and the parameter adjustment algorithm.
- Explore different model structures and parameters for linear regression models. Evaluate, if possible, 
the effects of outliers and overfitting.
- Evaluate the results in k-fold (k=10).

3 - Prediction and Comparison with Non-Linear Models:
- Evaluate the results in k-fold (k=10).
- Compare the results obtained with neural networks, SVM or other non-linear algorithm.
